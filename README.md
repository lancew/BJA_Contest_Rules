BJA_Contest_Rules Project
=========================

Started: 28 February 2013.

Introduction
============
The purpose of this project is to create the best Judo rulebook in the world using open collaboration and the pasisonate Judo community to craft a revision of the BJA Contest Rules.

Overview:
=========
By using version control and a collaborative environment like GitHub we will be able to collaborate and share in a transparent manner a re-write of the rule book.
GitHub allows people to work together and for us to communicate on changes and to share the changes and history of changes easily.
The more tech savy can use Git to manage their contribution, GitHub's web interface is simple enough to help the non geek Judoka contribute also.
